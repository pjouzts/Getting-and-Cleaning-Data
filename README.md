# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Geting and Cleaning Data Course Project Repository

run_analysis.R is the script for generating the tidy data set for the Course Project.

Data for the script is to be contained in a folder "UCI HAR Dataset" in the R working directory.  The script
will load the data as part of the analysis.

The function call is tidy <- run_analysis() which returns a grouped data frame by Subject and Activiy, with mean values
of the measurements

Unfortunately, I ran out of time to submit the code book :(
